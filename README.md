## Description

The purpose of this repository is develop an OpenC2 actuator profile (AP) for the management of HoneyPots. 

Open Command and Control (OpenC2) is a concise and extensible language to enable the command and control of cyber defense components, subsystems and/or systems in a manner that is agnostic of the underlying products, technologies, transport mechanisms or other aspects of the implementation. Honeypots are systems used to both detect the presence of an intruder attempting to breach a network or system and to divert an intruder from other targets. This OpenC2 Actuator Profile defines the Actions, Targets, Specifiers and Options that are consistent with the version 1.0 of the OpenC2 Language Specification ([OpenC2-Lang-v1.0]) in the context of command and control of various honeypots.
